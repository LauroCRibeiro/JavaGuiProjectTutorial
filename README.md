This course taught me how to create desktop and web-based applications using Java Swing, Java's built-in user interface toolkit. Each tutorial is fairly self-contained; but I also built two complete applications step by step along the way.

 Swing widgets, JDBC for database access, the graphics API, model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, serialization for saving data, the listener-event model and even basic animation.
